### Intro

I have packaged the macro as .xlam Excel Add-In which adds nice icon to the ribbon bar.

You can also use the code provided in .bas to run the macro without Add-In.

NOTE: Doesn't work on Excel for Mac.

### How it works

Macro gets JSON response from API and then parses the response and displays it on the message box.
